### Installation ###
1. Create a new python virtual env with python 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8 (3.8 recommended)
2. Install pytorch 1.10 with cuda-11.3:
    - `pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio`
3. Install Isaac Gym
   - Download and install Isaac Gym Preview 3 (Preview 2 will not work!) from https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym
   - `cd isaacgym/python && pip install -e .`
   - Try running an example `cd examples && python 1080_balls_of_solitude.py`
   - For troubleshooting check docs `isaacgym/docs/index.html`)
4. Install rsl_rl (PPO implementation)
   - Clone https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl
   -  `cd rsl_rl && git checkout v1.0.2 && pip install -e .` 
5. Install legged_gym
    - Clone this repository
   - `cd legged_gym && pip install -e .`

### Usage ###
1. Train:  
  ```python legged_gym/scripts/train.py --task=dualarm```
    -  To run on CPU add following arguments: `--sim_device=cpu`, `--rl_device=cpu` (sim on CPU and rl on GPU is possible).
    -  To run headless (no rendering) add `--headless`.
    - **Important**: To improve performance, once the training starts press `v` to stop the rendering. You can then enable it later to check the progress.
    - The trained policy is saved in `issacgym_anymal/logs/<experiment_name>/<date_time>_<run_name>/model_<iteration>.pt`. Where `<experiment_name>` and `<run_name>` are defined in the train config.
    -  The following command line arguments override the values set in the config files:
     - --task TASK: Task name.
     - --resume:   Resume training from a checkpoint
     - --experiment_name EXPERIMENT_NAME: Name of the experiment to run or load.
     - --run_name RUN_NAME:  Name of the run.
     - --load_run LOAD_RUN:   Name of the run to load when resume=True. If -1: will load the last run.
     - --checkpoint CHECKPOINT:  Saved model checkpoint number. If -1: will load the last checkpoint.
     - --num_envs NUM_ENVS:  Number of environments to create.
     - --seed SEED:  Random seed.
     - --max_iterations MAX_ITERATIONS:  Maximum number of training iterations.
2. Play a trained policy:  
```python legged_gym/scripts/play.py --task=dualarm```
    - By default, the loaded policy is the last model of the last run of the experiment folder.
    - Other runs/model iteration can be selected by setting `load_run` and `checkpoint` in the train config.
